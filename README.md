This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of useState and useEffect hooks. The app has two counters, "First" and "Second", each with buttons to increment or decrement their values. The useEffect hook is used to simulate data fetching on initial component mount.



- State Management: Uses the useState hook to manage two independent counter states.
- Effect Hook: Implements the useEffect hook to simulate data fetching on component mount.
- User Interaction: Provides buttons to increment and decrement the counter values.
